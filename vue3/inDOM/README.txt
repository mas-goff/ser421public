This directory contains examples of using Vue3 in small HTML-based examples. 
There is no build step required. The vue3-without-build folder has an example
from https://dev.to/krowemoh/a-vue3-tutorial-01-using-vue-without-a-build-step-2kkm
that shows how to use a 3rd-party library to load SFCs without a build step (not required for SER421).
