// union type concepts extend to objects, and there is an intersection concept too,

// What about interfaces? They look like object types:
interface IRectangle {

// same assignability cases apply here as they did with type Rectangle above
// What about the compatibility of type Rectangle and interface IRectangle?

// what is the difference then between types and interfaces? typed object literals are just 
// that - literals. They cannot be merged, used to check class declarations, etc. while interfaces can
// generally speaking then it is better (and usualy more intuitive) to use interfaces

// interfaces can have read-only values
// interfaces can have typed functions as interface members
